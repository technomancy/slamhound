;;; Commentary:

;; Destroys the ns form of a clojure-mode buffer and attempts to
;; rebuild it by searching the classpath. Requires an active
;; connection to either slime or nrepl.

;; M-x slamhound

;; If the namespace cannot be reconstructed for whatever reason, the
;; file will remain untouched and the reason will be shown.
